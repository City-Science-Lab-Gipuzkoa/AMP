1) Create the environment where you will install all the packages you need:
conda create -n myEnv
conda install pandas 
conda install ...
etc..

2) Save the newly created environment in a ".yml" file:

conda export > myenvironment.yml

Note: the "myenvironment.yml" file will contain (in the first line) the name of the enviroment (myEnv) you are using.
When, later on, you will use this file for the installation of a new environment, this name will be assigned to the new environment. 
So, if you want to change the name of the new environment, you need to change the first line of the "myenvironment.yml".

3) Use the ".yml" file to install the new environment: 

conda env create --file myenvironment.yml
